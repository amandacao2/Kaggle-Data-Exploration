question for kevin:

--do you HAVE to encode categorical data before using it? are you able to use it raw
--is there a way to save varibles acorss files so my notebook does get too long
--if standaridzation sort of transforms data into a different format then how does it perserve patterns in the original data that the model can learn from 
--help me the thing where im trying to determine if i can assum elinearlty or not
--ordinal encoding > label encdoing always???>
